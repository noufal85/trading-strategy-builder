# Trading Strategy Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides guidelines and examples for creating trading strategies using our Trading Strategy Builder and Backtesting Framework. It explains the structure of a strategy, how to implement it, and includes a sample strategy for reference.

## Strategy Implementation Guide

### Strategy Structure
Each trading strategy should implement the following components:

1. **Initialization**: Define parameters, indicators, and initial state
2. **Data Processing**: Handle incoming market data and update indicators
3. **Signal Generation**: Generate buy/sell signals based on market conditions
4. **Position Sizing**: Determine position size based on risk management rules
5. **Execution Logic**: Define entry and exit conditions
6. **Risk Management**: Implement stop-loss, take-profit, and other risk controls

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create a Strategy Class**:
   - Inherit from the base `Strategy` class
   - Define required parameters in the constructor
   - Initialize technical indicators

2. **Implement Core Methods**:
   - `on_data(data)`: Process new market data
   - `generate_signals()`: Create trading signals
   - `calculate_position_size(signal)`: Determine position size
   - `on_trade(trade)`: Handle trade execution events

3. **Define Strategy Logic**:
   - Implement your trading rules and conditions
   - Create custom indicators if needed
   - Define entry and exit criteria

4. **Add Risk Management**:
   - Implement stop-loss and take-profit rules
   - Add position sizing based on risk percentage
   - Define maximum drawdown limits

5. **Optimize and Test**:
   - Backtest the strategy with historical data
   - Optimize parameters for better performance
   - Validate with out-of-sample testing

## Strategy Status Tracking

Each strategy should include a status section:

```python
# Strategy Status
# ---------------
# Status: [In Progress/Completed]
# Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
# Version: X.Y.Z
```

## Sample Strategy: Moving Average Crossover

### Strategy Description

```python
"""
Moving Average Crossover Strategy

This strategy generates buy signals when a fast moving average crosses above
a slow moving average, and sell signals when the fast moving average crosses
below the slow moving average.

Parameters:
- fast_period: Period for the fast moving average (default: 20)
- slow_period: Period for the slow moving average (default: 50)
- risk_per_trade: Percentage of portfolio to risk per trade (default: 2%)
- stop_loss: Stop loss percentage (default: 3%)
- take_profit: Take profit percentage (default: 6%)

Status: In Progress
Last Updated: 2025-05-14
Version: 0.1.0
"""
```

### Implementation Logic (Pseudo-code)

```
CLASS MovingAverageCrossover:
    
    INITIALIZATION:
        - Set strategy parameters (fast_period, slow_period, risk_per_trade, stop_loss, take_profit)
        - Initialize fast and slow moving average indicators
        - Initialize tracking variables for previous indicator values
        - Initialize position tracking (size and entry price)
    
    FUNCTION on_data(market_data):
        - Update fast and slow moving averages with new price data
        - Store current indicator values
        - IF we have enough historical data THEN:
            - IF fast MA crosses above slow MA THEN:
                - Generate BUY signal
            - ELSE IF fast MA crosses below slow MA THEN:
                - Generate SELL signal
        - Store current values as previous values for next iteration
        - Return any generated signals
    
    FUNCTION calculate_position_size(signal, portfolio_value):
        - IF signal is BUY THEN:
            - Calculate stop price based on stop_loss percentage
            - Calculate risk amount based on portfolio value and risk_per_trade
            - Calculate position size based on risk amount and price difference to stop
            - Return position size
        - ELSE:
            - Return 0
    
    FUNCTION on_signal(signal, portfolio):
        - IF signal is BUY and no current position THEN:
            - Calculate position size
            - Set entry price to current price
            - Calculate stop loss and take profit levels
            - Return buy order details
        - ELSE IF signal is SELL and have existing position THEN:
            - Clear position tracking variables
            - Return sell order details
        - ELSE:
            - Return no action
    
    FUNCTION on_trade(trade):
        - Update strategy state based on executed trades
        - IF trade is BUY THEN:
            - Update position size and entry price
        - ELSE IF trade is SELL THEN:
            - Reset position tracking variables
```

### Backtesting Results

When implemented and backtested, this strategy should produce results similar to:

## Guidelines for Strategy Development

### Best Practices

1. **Clear Logic**: Define clear entry and exit conditions
2. **Robust Testing**: Test across different market conditions
3. **Risk Management**: Always include proper risk management rules
4. **Parameter Sensitivity**: Analyze sensitivity to parameter changes
5. **Avoid Overfitting**: Be cautious of curve-fitting to historical data
6. **Documentation**: Document your strategy thoroughly
7. **Incremental Development**: Start simple and add complexity gradually

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Look-ahead Bias**: Using future data in your strategy
2. **Survivorship Bias**: Testing only on surviving securities
3. **Overfitting**: Creating a strategy that works perfectly on historical data but fails in live trading
4. **Ignoring Transaction Costs**: Not accounting for commissions and slippage
5. **Insufficient Testing**: Not testing across different market regimes
6. **Poor Risk Management**: Risking too much on individual trades
7. **Complexity Without Benefit**: Adding complexity that doesn't improve performance
