# Trading Strategy Builder and Backtesting Framework

## Overview
This package provides a comprehensive framework for building, testing, and backtesting trading strategies. It allows traders and developers to define custom trading strategies, backtest them against historical data, and evaluate their performance using various metrics.

- [x] **Data Management**
  - [x] Historical data import (CSV, API)
  - [x] Data normalization and cleaning
  - [x] OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data support
  - [x] Multiple data providers (Yahoo Finance, Alpaca Markets)
  - [ ] Tick data support

- [x] **Backtesting Engine**
  - [x] Event-based backtesting system
